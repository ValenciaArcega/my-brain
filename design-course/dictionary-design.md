## Typography
Two types of <font color="#74c0fc">text presentation</font>
1.	Serif typeface. Has serifs on the letters. Aleo, Times.
2.	Sans-serif typeface. Are plain. Inter, Arial, Verdana.  

Use just one typeface in a project and choose the right one to use depending on the project personality  

<br>To create a good <font color="#74c0fc">reading experience</font>
- For "normal" text, we must use between 16px and 32px 
- For "header" text, we must use (50px+) and weight (600+) 
- For "long text" we must use (20px+)
- Use less than 75 characters per line
- Use line height
   - Normal text (1.5 to 2)
   - Big text (1.4 or below)
- Decrease the letter spacing in headlines
- Donot justify text
- Donot center long text blocks. Small blocks are fine

## Colors
Colors psychology is the study of how color affect our mood or behaviors.  
-	Black. security, luxury, formality, sadness
-	White. clean, minimalism, honesty, simplicity
-	Blue. trust, calmness, peace, loyalty, competence, sadness, depression
-	Red. excitement, love, danger, energy, error, strength
-	Orange. confidence, success, bravery sociability
-	Yellow. creativity, happiness, cheer, warmth
-	Green. health, growth, freshness, quality
-	Purple. luxury, ambition, royalty, spirituality.

<br><font color="#74c0fc">Best practices</font> colors
-	Choose a main color (will be to draw attention to the most important elements) and grey color to match your design personality
-	Use a good color tone! Donot choose a random tone.
-	For diversity, create tints and shades
-	Text should usually not be completely black. Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting
-	Donot make text too light. Use a tool to check contrast between text and background color.

## Images and Illustrations
-	Use images to support your design message and story. Only use relevant images
-	Prefer original images(not generic ones)
-	Try to show real people to trigger user’s emotions
-	To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x as big as their displayed size (600px)
-	Compress images for a lower file size and better performance
-	When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions.
### Icons
-	Use only one icon pack. Donot mix icons from different packs.
-	Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Donot use bitmap image formats(jpg or png)
-	Use icons to provide visual assistance to text
-	Use icons for product feature blocks
-	Donot confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the text or action.

## Shadows
-	Use shadows in small doses: donot add shadows to every element
-	Go light on shadows, don’t make them too dark
-	Use large shadows for elements that should really float above the interface
-	Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction (click and hover)

## Border-radius
-	Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that border-radius matches that roundness!


## Whitespace
-	Use tons of whitespace between sections, a lot of in groups of elements and regular for elements
-	Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing, let breathe elements!

## User Experience (UX)
-	Donot design complicated layouts. Donot reinvent the wheel. Use patterns that users know
-	Use blue text and underlined text only for links
-	Animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 200 and 500 milliseconds
-	In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, to make the form easier to scan
-	Only include relevant information, efficiently. Cut out fluff(dust) and make the content 100% clear
-	Use simple words. Avoid technical jargon and “smart sounding” words
